Echocardiography is a widely performed procedure to diagnose cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, aorta, and pericardial disease. This activity reviews the importance of adult echocardiography and highlights the interprofessional team's role in performing this procedure.

**Objectives:**

  * Identify the indications for echocardiography.

  * Assess the anatomy of structures on the echocardiogram.

  * Evaluate the clinical significance of echocardiography.

  * Highlight how an interprofessional team approach can enhance patient outcomes by ensuring effective use of echocardiography in appropriate patient populations.

## Introduction

Echocardiography is a non-invasive diagnostic modality that examines the structure and function of the heart and great vessels. In 1950, the German scientist Wolfe Dieter Keidel utilized the transmitted ultrasonic wave technique to study the heart. However, he was not able to create information regarding cardiac function.[1] In 1953, Dr. Inge, the father of echocardiography and inventor of M-Mode, and Dr. Helmut Hertz established a commercial ultrasound machine to study the heart.[2] The development of echocardiography modalities such as M-Mode, A-mode, Doppler, transthoracic, transesophageal, contrast, stress echocardiography, and strain imaging took decades and helped achieve prompt diagnoses of various cardiac illnesses.

## Personnel

  1. Gastrointestinal bleeding

  2. Esophageal perforation

  3. Pharyngeal hematoma

  4. Aspiration

  5. Laryngospasm

  6. Arrhythmia

  7. Toxic methemoglobinemia [9][10]

**Stress Echocardiography**

  1. Myocardial infarction

  2. Arrhythmia

  3. Coronary spasm

  4. Hypertension or hypotension secondary to medication [11][12]

## Clinical Significance

**Transthoracic echocardiography** : a non-invasive, low-cost, widely available, first-line diagnostic test to evaluate cardiac disease and function. It not only helps to diagnose cardiac disease but also provides useful information to guide therapy.

**Transesophageal echocardiography** : an invasive test in which transthoracic echo is inconclusive or needs further information on infectious endocarditis. The esophagus's proximity to the heart and absence of intervening structures such as the lung make the Transesophageal echo ideal for examining various important structures.

**Stress echocardiography** : including imaging in routine stress testing increases the sensitivity and specificity of the test in diagnosing coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography post-myocardial infarction helps in risk stratification, location, and extent of coronary artery disease. Stress echocardiography can also be used to risk-stratify patients before non-cardiac surgery, as resting echo does not provide essential prognostic information.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

To perform echocardiography requires an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist and an echo technician. It is vital to take a proper history and perform a pre-procedure physical examination to determine the indication of the procedure. Communication between echo technicians and the cardiologist is essential, especially when there is a discrepancy in results.
