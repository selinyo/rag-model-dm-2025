Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with mechanical pleurodesis and bleb/bullectomy reduces the recurrence rate of pneumothorax to less than 5%, and this surgical intervention is indicated for patients with bilateral pneumothoraces, continuous air leak for longer than seven days, or first episodes in high-risk profession patients such as divers and pilots.
