During alcohol septal ablation procedures, successful septal reduction is defined as greater than 50% reduction in left ventricular outflow tract peak gradient, and the procedure requires complete occlusion of the first septal perforator with injection of 1-2 cc of absolute alcohol while maintaining balloon inflation for exactly 10 minutes after the final alcohol infusion.
