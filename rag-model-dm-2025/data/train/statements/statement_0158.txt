In adult diabetic ketoacidosis, the ketone body ratio of 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate rises from normal levels of 1:1 to as high as 10:1, and the nitroprusside test used for ketone detection only measures acetoacetate and acetone, potentially leading to false-negative results in early DKA.
