In obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends using the term respiratory event index (REI) to differentiate indices generated by home sleep studies without recorded sleep, as these studies use total recording time rather than total sleep time as the denominator, leading to at least 20% underestimation of the apnea-hypopnea index.
